## Project Motivation and Purpose

Draft preparation is ultimately the key to a successful fantasy season. This project was designed so that I could actively see projected data for each perspective player as they are picked in the draft. The football_analysis notebook should be run during the draft and updated based on the descriptions within the notebook. 

## Files

**football_analysis.ipynb**: The file that is designed to be used during the live draft. It scrapes and pulls rankings performed by CBS, Sporting News, ESPN, and myself. These rankings are then compared on a per-player basis.
